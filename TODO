 +  fix bug: wrong parsing of queries like "john smith|barbara streisand"

 *  all special symbols should be configurable (ORs, ANDs, colons, etc)
 *  add screening of special symbols, e.g. \"
 *  rewrite parser so that special symbols can be words, not symbols (like OR instead of |). Parser should operate on tokens, not characters.
